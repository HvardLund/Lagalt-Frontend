# Lagalt - Frontend
## Overview
This repository contains the code for the frontend of the LagAlt project handed out as a mandatory exercise at the Noroff acceleration program (spring 2023).

The project consists of creating the website lagalt.no, a platform that aims to facilitate connecting individuals in creative fields with projects that requires specific skills. In order to apply to join or create projects, the user must register with a username and create a password. After registering, the user accesses their profile page which will contain a portfolio of their projects, in addition to a user description and the users skills. The website also has a main page which contains projects by other users. By clicking on one of these projects, the user will get to the project page, the last of the three pages the website contains. In this page, application to the specific project clicked can be done. 

The website uses Oauth for handling authentication, and the website's backend exposes REST API endpoints and utilizes SQLServer for the database. 

## Development
The frontend framework used is React. Further info can be found in the sections below.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
